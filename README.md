Features
Search movies by title using the OMDb API.
Filter movies by release year.
Display movie details like box office collection, plot, poster, ratings, etc.
Handle API responses and errors gracefully.
Responsive user interface using Bootstrap.
Clear and organized codebase following best practices.
Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure of the web pages.
CSS3: Styling for the user interface.
JavaScript (ES6): Functionality for fetching movie data from the API and managing user interactions.
Bootstrap 5: For responsive design and pre-styled components.
OMDb API: Provides movie data based on user queries.
Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow the steps below.

Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Node.js installed (optional, only if you use a server to run the project).
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-search-app.git
cd movie-search-app
Download Bootstrap & Other Dependencies: If you're using Bootstrap via CDN, ensure you have an internet connection, or you can download Bootstrap and include it in the project.

Open in Browser: Simply open the index.html file in your browser to view the application.

API Key Configuration
To use the OMDb API, you will need to obtain an API key from here.

Go to the OMDb API website.
Register and get your free API key.
In the project, locate the main.js file (or wherever your API calls are handled) and insert your API key.
Example:

js
Copy code
const apiKey = 'your_omdb_api_key_here';
How to Use
Search for Movies:

Type the name of a movie in the search bar.
You can filter the search results by entering a release year.
Click the "Search" button to fetch the results.
View Movie Details:

For each movie result, the app will display the poster, title, year, and a link to view more information (e.g., IMDb).
If a movie has missing data (like box office earnings), appropriate messages will be shown.

Code Explanation
index.html:

Contains the basic structure of the application including the search form and results section.
Uses Bootstrap classes for layout and styling.
main.js:

Fetches data from the OMDb API using fetch().
Implements functionality for displaying search results, handling errors, and managing user inputs.
styles.css:

Custom styling for enhancing the appearance of the movie cards, search form, and overall layout.
Optional Enhancements
Here are some optional features you can add:

Favorites List: Allow users to save their favorite movies in a local storage list.
Additional Filters: Implement additional filters like genre or ratings.
Movie Trailers: Integrate another API to display movie trailers.
Sort Options: Allow users to sort movies by year, rating, or box office.
Assumptions
If the OMDb API does not return specific data (e.g., box office earnings), a placeholder message like "Data unavailable" is displayed.
The project assumes users will enter valid search queries (basic input validation is performed).
